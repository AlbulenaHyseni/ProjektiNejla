        Special birthdays, anniversaries, births and deaths or transitions into parenthood and marriage are all occasions marked with special flowers.
         A walk down the aisle is incomplete without a beautiful bouquet of flowers in hand. They become a
        fragrant talisman held close to bring good luck as we traverse over the thresholds in our lives. It doesnâ€™t always require a major life transition
        either to experience or appreciate the value that a posy of fragrant flowers can provide. They can simply just make any moment that much brighter
         and memorable. Flowers are infused with such power that we keep them close during the vulnerable moments in our live.
